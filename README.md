# UCS - Astar Algorithms

This programming exercise is about a labyrinth with obstacles, in which a robot have to navigate from the initial point to a final one. In order to 
achieve this goal it uses both algorithms to find the best solution. The UCS algorithm always find a full and best solution with exponential complexity of both time and space. 
This algorithm belongs to blind search algorithms. The Astar algorithm is based to a heuristic function, which expands the search frontier. 
If the heuristic function for every state n is smaller or equal to the actual distance, then the function is called admissible. Only then we can say that the method has a full and best path solution.
